## About
This code is to create a provable smart contract lottery system 

## What we want it to do?

1. Users should be able to enter the raffle by buying a ticket. The cumulative sum of all the tickets bought is the prize the winner receives.
2. The lottery should automatically and fairly draw a winner on its own.
3. Chainlink VRF should be used to generate a provable random number.
4. Chainlink automation should trigger the lottery draw automatically.
